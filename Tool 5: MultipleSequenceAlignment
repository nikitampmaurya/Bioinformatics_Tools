Aim: To perform multiple sequence alignment using linux, bash, python and muscle.
Description: The folder "myuniprotsids" contains all the uniprot ids. The folder "get_myuniprotdata.sh" contains the script to perform alignment. 
The folder "convert_aln_to_clw" to transform the .aln file to .clw for visualization.
